Practical Task 2

A
1) A strong sense of urgency or pressure
Banks frequently notify consumers via text, phone, or email of any questionable
account activity, particularly if they have signed up for alerts. However, reputable
banks rarely utilise the alarming or menacing rheotoric that scammers frequently use.
Criminals utilise false bank notifications to induce a sense of immediacy and scare
their victims into responding quickly, prior to their sense of vigilance can completely set it.
2) Software Installation Guidelines
Hackers routinely attempt to obtain victim's private data by fooling them into installing 
software, typically claiming that the software is required for account or device
protection. However, the applications peddled by scammers are often used to remotely
control one's devices and steal personal or banking data. While it is critical to maintain
one's devices'security software up to date, constantly verify that you are installing 
software from a legitimate, confirmed source. 
3) Demand for Personal Data
A legitimate bank would never contact customers by phone, email, or text to enquire for 
the account owner's username and password, PIN number, or other critical account information
If you receive correspondence requesting for confidential data, deem it a clear sign that you have recieved
a fraudelent bank account message. To protect your information and assets, never submit 
this type of date unless one is logged securely into the bank's official website or are confident
that you are speaking with an authorised representative.

B
1.) Yes, these emails have malicious attachment that may lead to a fake ID stealing site.
C.
1) Training colleagues on phising, social engineering, and malware mitigation is critical for protecting both individual 
users and the entire organization from cyber dangers. A arguably, the most popular cyberattacks is phishing, 
which disguises itself as authentic messages in texts,emails, or telephone calls in order to fool people into disclosing
confidential data such as username and password, financial data, or confidential documents.
Staff should be educated to recognise red signs such as misaligned email addresses, grammar errors,
dubious attachments, and links that differ from the legitimate domain. In contrast, social engineering is based on human
psychology rather than technology. Hackers may impersonate trustworthy coworkers, IT personnel, or even upper 
management in order to trick people into breaking security standards. Employees should be encouraged to use caution 
even when demands seem to originate from within the organisation, to verify unexpected directives via secondary channels, and to 
avoid feelng forced to act hastily without sufficient checks.
Malware infestations, which are commonly caused bt opening malicious links, downloading dubious software, or connecting in strange USB
devices, can compromise sensitive information, impede operations, and harm an organization's brand. Training 
ought to emphasise the importance of using most recent antivirus software, avoid untrustworthy downloads, and downloading
updates as soon as possible to address known vulnerabilities. Personnel must also appreciate the necessity of using
unique and secure passwords, activating two-factor authentication where feasible, and reporting questionable occurrence
immediately so that the IT staff can respond fast.
Actual scenarios and interactive simulations are especially helpful at reinforcing 
these skills because they allow employees to witness firsthand how persuasive phishing emails or phone calls may be.
Furthermore, creating a culture in which staff members are at ease raising questins or double-checking possible hazards
without fear of repercussions increases collective resilience. Eventually, the purpose of this training is to develop a 
workforce that is both watchful and confident, capable of recognising misleading techniques, avoiding risky behaviours, 
and serving as the first line of defence against ever-changing cyber threats.
